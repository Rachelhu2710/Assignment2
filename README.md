PUMA is a famous branded company that sells all type of sports things.

## Design Process
The reason why we wanted to design this website is so to attract more people to buy PUMA products and at the same time be able to afford it at a cheaper pricing with the points or the vouchers they earn. Points earned from this website can be redeem to ofset the total price or free delivery, there is also games for them to earn points this is to attract customers to return and buy things it can also attract new customers to spend. My webpage allows users to earn points by playing games or purchasing items from the store and these points can be used to ofset the total pricing. As a user:
- I would want to purchase things of a cheaper pricing
- I would want to have points that are able to ofset the total price
- I would want to have ways to earn more points rather than earning points through the total amount i purchase
- I would want to know the contact information
- I would want to have games to earn points or vouchers
