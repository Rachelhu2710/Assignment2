    <h2>History of PUMA</h2>
    <p class="history">
        Puma, is a German multinational corporation that designs and manufactures athletic and casual footwear, apparel and 
        accessories, which is headquartered in Herzogenaurach, Bavaria, Germany. Puma is the third largest sportswear manufacturer 
        in the world.The company was founded in 1948 by Rudolf Dassler. In 1924, Rudolf and his brother Adolf "Adi" Dassler had 
        jointly formed the company Gebrüder Dassler Schuhfabrik (Dassler Brothers Shoe Factory). The relationship between the two 
        brothers deteriorated until the two agreed to split in 1948, forming two separate entities, Adidas and Puma.Following the 
        split, Rudolf originally registered the newly established company as Ruda (derived from Rudolf Dassler, as Adidas was based on 
        Adi Dassler), but later changed the name to Puma.Puma's earliest logo consisted of a square and beast jumping through a D,
        which was registered, along with the company's name, in 1948. Puma's shoe and clothing designs feature the Puma logo and the 
        distinctive "Formstrip" which was introduced in 1958.
